# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML(K-Means Clustering)

Task : From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
This is Task-2 of The Sparks Foundation Grip.This task is based on Unsupervised Machine Learning.

In this task I used K-Means Clustering to make clusters of the dataset based on its features.
